# Welcome to the Glasgow Gut Translational Research Group üëã

We are a multidisciplinary research group based at the University of Glasgow, led by **Professor Gwo-Tzer Ho**, with a mission to advance our understanding of gut biology and disease-specific mechanisms in **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)**. Our work bridges basic discovery science with translational research, focusing on immune-metabolism, biomarker discovery, and interventional trials.

## üåü Our Research Focus

Our group is dedicated to uncovering the mechanisms underlying gut health and disease, with a strong emphasis on **human patient data** and **biosamples**. Key areas of research include:

- **Mitochondrial Danger Signals in IBD (MUSIC Study)**: A Scotland-wide longitudinal cohort study exploring how the gut heals in IBD using clinical and multi-omic approaches.
- **Mitochondrial Antioxidant Therapy (MARVEL Study)**: A UK multicenter Phase 2 RCT investigating oral mitochondrial antioxidants in Ulcerative Colitis.
- **Oral-Gut Microbiome Interactions**: Studying immune responses in Crohn‚Äôs disease.
- **Fatigue in IBD**: Large-scale characterization of IBD-associated fatigue to uncover mechanisms and develop therapeutic approaches.
- **Metabolic Approaches to Gut Repair**: Using patient-derived organoids to enhance gut healing.
- **Novel Diagnostic Technologies**: Developing mitochondrial and metabolic markers, including the ERC-funded IDXsense project for Granzyme B tests to stratify T-cell responses in IBD.
- **Imaging Approaches (FATE-CD)**: Using PET-MRI FAPI scanning to monitor fibrosis in Crohn‚Äôs disease.
- **Macrophage Biology in Crohn‚Äôs Disease**: Investigating immune cell behavior in IBD.

## üß™ Current Clinical Studies

- **[MARVEL Study](https://www.marvelstudy.uk)**: A UK multicenter Phase 2 RCT investigating the use of oral mitochondrial antioxidants in Ulcerative Colitis.
- **[MUSIC Study](https://www.musicstudy.uk)**: A Scotland-wide longitudinal cohort study exploring mitochondrial danger signals and gut healing in IBD.

## üî¨ Experimental Platforms

Our research is powered by cutting-edge experimental platforms, including:

- Patient-derived organoids and immune cells
- Multi-omic data integration
- Advanced imaging techniques (e.g., PET-MRI)
- In vitro experimental platforms for studying the human IBD gut
